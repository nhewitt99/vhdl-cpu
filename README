***BUILDING***
To build the CPU, ghdl must be installed. I'm sure it can also be done in Vivado,
but I didn't have 40 free GB to download that. Once ghdl is installed, run:
    $ cd {this directory}
    $ ghdl -a *.vhd tb/*.vhd
    $ ghdl -e singlecycletb
    $ ghdl -e pipelinedtb
    
    
***RUNNING***
After building as above, run either:
    $ ghdl -r singlecycletb
for the single cycle version, or:
    $ ghdl -r pipelinedtb
for the pipelined version.

They will initialize their instruction memory with the data found in
"data/program.dat". To change what program is run, simply copy the data from
fibonacci.dat, sample.dat, or samplepipelined.dat into program.dat.

Note that the pipelined architecture will only behave correctly when running
the samplepipelined.dat, because the other two are ripe with data hazards.
